# odin-recipes
This is going to be my first project with The Odin Project.
I will demonstrate my knowledge of basic HTML. I will use elements such as anchors, images, paragraphs, headings, and many more. I will also practice using git by adopting an atomic git habit. Where I will commit every time there is a change.
